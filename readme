Biophysical model of CA1 pyramidal neurons with synaptic plasticity rule (Clopath et al. 2010) and direct current stimulation

This is a detailed biophysical model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron based on Migliore et al. 2005.  Synaptic conductances and learning rules are based on models from Kim et al. 2015 and Clopath et al. 2010, respectively.
